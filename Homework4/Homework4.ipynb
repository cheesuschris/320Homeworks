      "(\"The content was oddly specific, and there was a lot of memorization of seemingly pointless things that we should be able to look up in the real world.\\r\\nIn general, it was hard to understand what was important in the course content and why it was important.\\r\\nKofinas was an ok lecturer, somewhat boring, but the biggest issue is just not knowing how to study for tests.\\r\\nVery helpful method of giving us the homework solutions before the homework was due. I actually learned a lot more from looking at the homework solutions than from the class, and if he had put up the solutions after the homework was due, I probably wouldn't have checked the solutions as carefully.\", 3)\n",
      "(\"He's a good guy, but he can be a real tough ass sometimes. His class starts off fairly easy, but it gets significantly harder with a bunch of polymer math. He's not the most engaging in lecture which makes it hard to follow. There a lot of things which aren't on the slides that he tests you on, so recording lectures can be a good idea. The one thing I like about his class is that he spends a good amount of time talking about applications of biomaterials in medical devices. This was really interesting and unlike other BIOE classes where a bunch of useless equations are shoved down your throat, I feel that I learned something useful in this class. His class isn't all that easy and you are going to have to work if you want to get an A. Overall I feel that Kofinas was a pretty good professor and that I did learn a lot from taking his class. \", 4)\n",

      "(\"Kofinas wasn't a great professor, but he wasn't bad either. Would try to help all of his students, but didn't do well at actually helping. In this class though, that didn't really matter to much as he didn't actually have to teach us anything.\\n\\r\\nEasy class, not difficult by any means, and has a major curve.\\n\\r\\nWhen it comes to building your hovercraft, be creative, and make sure you stay involved in your group. Present your ideas clearly in your presentation and you will be set. Kofinas' biggest pet peeve was when people copied older designs. He would rather you built a totally new design that didn't work as well.\", 3)\n",
      "(\"If you have the opportunity, I would definitely suggest taking ENES100 with Dr. Kofinas. Go out of your way to talk to him occasionally, because you want him to know your name and that you're contributing to your group.\\n\\r\\nPROS:\\r\\na really nice guy, very willing to help when he can (or at least tell you which other professor to ask), and very reasonable with assigning milestone and final grades.\\n\\r\\nCONS:\\r\\nlectures are long and not very exciting (but what can you expect when a professor is expected to cover everything from physics, to electronics and programming), at least 2/5 questions on the ENES100 midterms always seem to be awful (in-depth questions on topics covered for a week), and the success of your group really depends on how lucky you are with members (i.e. how many good computer/electrical engineers you get)... but those last two are just related to the course as a whole\", 4)\n"
