       "I'm a single mom with four kids, one of whom has a different father from the other three. I get a lot of child support for one of them, and none for the other 3. 2/3rds of the child support for the eldest go towards his expenses and college fund. The other third goes towards my other children. My friend recently found out and told me it was inappropriate to use the child support intended for the one on the other three. Am I a jerk?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             object\n",
       "I have a child with a mother who never wanted anything to do with them. I make enough money to cover my expenses, but I constantly check up on the child's mother to make sure she's paying adequate child support. Periodically I either hire an investigator or her mom just tells me she got a raise and I go to court to adjust the child support accordingly. The last time I did this, she didn't show up for court and I apparently overestimated how much her raise was and I got a default judgment. She called me up and practically pleaded with me to lower her payments after I said no she insulted me and my son.

When I met with them, they said there wasn't actually a reward, they had just listed one because they thought it would motivate people to find the cat. I kept the cat until they coughed up the reward money. Am I a jerk?\n",

One day, my sister dropped the daughter off on my doorstep without my consent and drove off, texting me that she needed me to watch her daughter for the day. The daughter complained of being hungry, so I gave her the leftovers I had. She said she didn't like them, but I told her that's all there was. She put them in the microwave until they burned, then told me she couldn't eat them and we would have to go out and get food. I told her that was what there was to eat, and if she ruined it she'd have to wait for her mom to get back. Later, everyone yelled at me for 'starving' a child. Am I a jerk?\n",

I make enough money to cover my expenses, but I constantly check up on the child's mother to make sure she's paying adequate child support.

The last time I did this, she didn't show up for court and I apparently overestimated how much her raise was and I got a default judgment. She called me up and practically pleaded with me to lower her payments after I said no she insulted me and my son. Am I a jerk?\n",
